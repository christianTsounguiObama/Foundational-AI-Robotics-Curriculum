# Foundational AI & Robotics Curriculum

![Project Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg) <!-- Optional: Create a banner in assets/banner.png for a professional look -->

Welcome! This repository is an open-source curriculum designed to teach the foundational, practical skills required for a career in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

My mission is to create and share a clear, accessible, and high-quality series of learning modules. Each module consists of:
*   A **visual cheatsheet** (in English & French) summarizing a core concept.
*   A detailed **Jupyter Notebook** (in English & French) that puts the theory into practice on a real dataset.

This project is for aspiring data scientists, engineers, and anyone looking to build the skills that will power the next generation of technology, with a special focus on empowering the African tech ecosystem.

-   An environment manager like `venv` (recommended) or `conda`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/christianTsounguiObama/Foundational-AI-Robotics-Curriculum.git
    cd Foundational-AI-Robotics-Curriculum
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    Each numbered folder is a self-contained project.
    ```bash
    cd 1-Machine-Learning/01-ML-Cheatsheet-Roadmap
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
